Input File Based Renamer
========================

Input File Based Renamer is a simple application that parses a given multi-line text file and renames the files in a specified folder according to the lines extracted from the input file. File extensions are ignored.

For example, a file containing the lines: 
ACAT
BCAT

will result in the first two files in the specified folder being renamed to: (assuming they are jpg files)
ACAT.jpg
BCAT.jpg
